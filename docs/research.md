# Research

This section contains technical deep-dives, experiments, and analysis beyond standard write-ups.

Not just exploitation — understanding attack surfaces, patterns, and defensive gaps.

## 🔍 Active Directory Attack Patterns

Exploring common AD misconfigurations observed across HTB, Pro Labs, and CTF environments.

Topics include:

- ACL abuse patterns
- Kerberos delegation abuse
- Service account exposure
- Attack path chaining

---

## 🧠 Enumeration Strategy Analysis

Comparing automated vs manual enumeration approaches:

- Nmap vs Rustscan
- BloodHound data interpretation
- LDAP query strategies
- PrivEsc detection patterns

---

## 🧪 Lab Experiments

Documenting personal lab experiments:

- Custom vulnerable AD setups
- Kerberoasting lab
- NTLM relay testing
- Lateral movement simulations

---

## 📊 Exploitation Case Studies

Breaking down complex attack chains:

- Initial foothold → Domain compromise
- Privilege escalation via misconfigured GPO
- Credential reuse in segmented networks

---

## 🧩 Lessons & Observations

Patterns repeatedly seen across machines:

- Weak service account hygiene
- Over-permissioned AD objects
- Web → AD pivot patterns
- Misconfigured backup systems
